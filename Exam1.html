<h1>Exam 1</h1>
Create a JSTest class (using prototype) which has the following methods:

<li>
    <li> <strong>getPrimeNumbers:</strong> Which prints the first N ‘prime’ numbers (N is a value provided by the user)</li>
    <li> <strong> getFactorial:</strong> Which calculates the factorial of a given number (number provided by the user).</li>
    <li> <strong> countVowels:</strong> Which counts the number of vowels ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’ and ‘u’ that a given paragraph
        has (paragraph provided by the user).</li>
    <li> <strong>evalParagraph:</strong> Which, given a long paragraph and a letter/char provided by the user, print the
        count and all the words that contain the specified char.

    <li>Example. var paragraph = ‘hello world’;<br>
    var letter = ‘h’;<br>
    ⇒ Count is: 1<br>
    ⇒ Words: hello </li>
    </li>
    <li>Create a separate file which has an auto-executable function in order to run all methods (all
        4 above exercises) from JSTest class</li>
</ul>
